Associative are not ordered. It's like looking through just the labels. 
Key-Value Pair is how you find them.

AA arrays are made just the same as normal arrays but its the contents that matter.

<?php $assoc = array("first_name" => "Kevin, "last_name" => Skoglund"); ?>
~this is a key value pair to call it you 

<?php echo $assoc["first_name"]; ?>
<?php echo $assoc["first_name"] . " " . $assoc["last_name"]; ?>
