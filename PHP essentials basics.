Basics in PHP

Arrays
<?php $mixed = array(6, "fox", "dog", array("x", "y", "z")); ?>
~all this does is make an array and now there is an array in the array 
<?php echo $mixed[2];?> 
~this will print out "dog" 
~<?php echo $mixed[3][1];?> 
~this will print out "y"

A good trick to see the contents of the array 

<pre>
<?php echo print_r($mixed);?>
</pre>

~this prints out the array and INDENTS it all very useful to see the array within the array.

<?php mixed[2] = "cat"; ?> 
~changes the [2] from "dog" to cat
<?php mixed[] = "horse"; ?> 
~appends to the end of array horse.
